  Services are unchanged.

  Ensured uniqueness of topics and services being passed into the system using sets.

  Removed unnecessary ws_name code.

  Issue #27.

  Staniaszek]

  The lists *_waiting now contain topics, services or actions which we are
  expecting, but do not currently exist. Once it comes into existence, we remove
  it from this list.

  When services disconnect, their loss is no longer permanent. This had to do with
  the services being removed and not added to the waiting list.

  Fixes issue #21.
- Full regex, fixed reconfigure crash. [Michal Staniaszek]

  Can now use full regex in topic or service strings to match incoming strings.

  Fixed crash when dynamic reconfigure receives an invalid string
- Merge pull request #22 from asmodehn/feature-devel. [AlexV]

  Wildcard implementation
- Strings with no match characters don't add unwanted topics. [Michal
  Staniaszek]

  match anywhere in the string.

  Issue #17.
- Removed separate lists for match strings. [Michal Staniaszek]
- Remove printing, unnecessary adding to _args arrays. [Michal
  Staniaszek]
- Adding wildcard * for exposing topics or services. [Michal Staniaszek]

  Hacky, working around a limitation of rospy ( cannot publish on a

  design would be to call directly the python method ( work with
  services - node_init not needed ) [AlexV]

  No ROS signal handlers anymore. Cleanup properly done when program
  interrupted. [AlexV]
